# Project Description
This project is a nodeJS console application.
It is a personal project that I quickly put together in order to archive videos from YouTube that are likely to diseappear.  
This app first gets the urls of the videos from my Plex Media Server "watch later" playlist and then goes on with the download.
It uses a small package I published on NPM => https://www.npmjs.com/package/@boostup/plex-api

# TO DO
- replace promise syntax with async/await so that I can try/catch better
- create a new npm package with the files in utils folder found in:
    - this project
    - survey-sample-gen
